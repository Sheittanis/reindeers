I've spoken to <color=white>Vixen</color> and she's agreed to join us without her bindings, because they creep me out.
As the name would suggest <color=white>Vixen</color> is very healthy.
Like a Chistmasy Jamie Oliver.
Except a reindeer.
And not British.
And a female.
And named <color=white>Vixen</color> instead of Jamie Oliver.
Now that I think about it <color=white>Vixen</color> is more of a pastry chef anyway.
<i>I told him not to go in the back door!</i>
