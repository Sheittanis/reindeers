I've spoken to <color=yellow>Blitzen</color> and she actually acknowledged my existence!
Out of her almighty benevolence she has agreed to help us.
Praise!
As the name would suggest <color=yellow>Blitzen</color> is very, very, very good at absolutely everything.
Like a Chistmasy Chuck Norris.
Except a reindeer.
And not American.
And a female.
And named <color=yellow>Blitzen</color> instead of Chuck Norris.
Now that I think about it <color=yellow>Blitzen</color> is more of a bad-ass than Chuck Norris anyway.
How about that punchline then?
<i>Because every buck is dear to him.</i>
