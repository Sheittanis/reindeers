I've spoken to <color=purple>Dancer</color> and she agrees that the woodland critters are far more useful than you are.
As the name would suggest <color=purple>Dancer</color> is very nimble and maneuverable.
Like a Chistmasy Micheal Jackson.
Except a reindeer.
And not American.
And a female.
And named <color=purple>Dancer</color> instead of Micheal Jackson.
Now that I think about it <color=purple>Dancer</color> is more of a classical ballroom dancer anyway.
How about that punchline then?
