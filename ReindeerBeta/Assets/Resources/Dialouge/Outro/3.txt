I've spoken to <color=orange>Dasher</color> and no force is necessary.
As the name would suggest <color=orange>Dasher</color> is very fast.
Like a Chistmasy Usain Bolt.
Except a reindeer.
And not Jamaican.
And a female.
And named <color=orange>Dasher</color> instead of Usain Bolt.
Now that I think about it <color=orange>Dasher</color> is more of a long distance runner anyway.
How about that punchline then?
