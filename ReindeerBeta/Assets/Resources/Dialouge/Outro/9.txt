I've spoken to <color=green>Prancer</color> and she's agreed to join us.
Also in unrelated news, you no longer have to work without pay.
As the name would suggest <color=green>Prancer</color> is very good at jumping.
Like a Chistmasy Dick Fosbury.
Except a reindeer.
And not American.
And a female.
And named <color=green>Prancer</color> instead of Dick Fosbury.
Now that I think about it <color=green>Prancer</color> is more of a long jumper anyway.
How about that punchline then?
<i>She's a rain-deer!</i>
