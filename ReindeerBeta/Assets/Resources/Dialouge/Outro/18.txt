I've spoken to Cupid and she says christmas is really just about love anyway.
What a nutcracker.
As the name would suggest <color=fuchsia>Cupid</color> is very good at getting up when she's knocked down.
Like a Chistmasy Chumbawamba.
Except a reindeer.
And not British.
And a female.
And named <color=fuchsia>Cupid</color> instead of Chumbawamba.
Now that I think about it  is more of a electronic post-progressive jive-step dub-core kind of musician anyway.
How about that punchline then?
<i>A lost clause</i>
