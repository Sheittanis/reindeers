I've spoken to Comet and she tells me that asteroids, comets and metoers aren't even the same thing.
As the name would suggest Comet is very tough.
Like a Chistmasy Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
Except a reindeer.
And not American.
And a female.
And named Comet instead of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
Now that I think about it Comet is more of an MMA fighter anyway.
How about that punchline then?
<i>A rebel without a Claus.</i>
