I've spoken to <color=red>Rudolph</color> and I wish I hadn't.
As the name would suggest <color=red>Rudolph</color> is very, terrible.
Like a Chistmasy Ivan IV of Russia.
Except a reindeer.
And not Russian.
And a female.
And named <color=red>Rudolph</color> instead of Ivan IV of Russia.
Now that I think about it Rubolph is more of a William I of England anyway.
How about that punchline then?
<i>"Rude"-olph</i>
