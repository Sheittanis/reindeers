Some news, I guess.
A reindeer that, believe it or not, might actually be worse than you is bumbling around somewhere nearby.
The woodland critters weren't sure it was even worth reporting, but they discovered <color=red>Rudolph</color> wandering around in circles up ahead.
She's pretty feabile so she'll be easy to nab.
But she's such a guillable idiot that it shouldn't take much convincing to get her to come home anyway.
Even though neither of you deserve it, here's a hilarious joke.
<i>Which of Santa's reindeer has bad manners?</i>
