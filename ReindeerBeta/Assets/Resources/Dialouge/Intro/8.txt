The elves have recuited the penguins into their gang of <b>yellow-eyed</b> rascals.	
They said something about the penguin that <b>snares</b> you, or gets you hung by the <b>chinstrap</b>, gets to be the <b>king</b> of the arctic!
Or maybe it was <b>emperor</b>.
Something about becoming <b>royal</b>.
When I hear your name I just have very <b>little</b> attention.
You should really be <b>humboldt</b> that they talk about you at all.
And that they would come to the north pole just to murder you.
Because penguins live near the south pole, in places like <b>Adelie</b>, <b>Africa</b>, <b>Fiordland</b> and the <b>Galapagos</b>.
Also something about Erect-crested, Gentoo, Macaroni, Magellanic and Rockhopper penguins.
Look, I don't have all day to write penguin puns, I'm actually trying to save Santa.
But I did have time to write you this hilarious joke.
