<b>Marvelous news!</b>
A reindeer far more attractive than you has been catching the eye of my informants.
Once again, you are yet to find anyone we are looking for, and the woodland critters have found <color=white>Vixen</color>.
This one is really a win win because I hear she likes being bound and gagged anyway.
I think she must be a few brussell sprouts short of a chirstmas dinner.
But hopefully she'll understand my hilarious joke.
