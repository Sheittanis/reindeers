<b>Good news!</b>
Seems that just like when they left you, the elves are shedding some dead weight.
Reports from the woodland critters tell me that <color=orange>Dasher</color> has been spotted up ahead.
Maybe if we can rescue her from the elves, she will join us.
And if not, then we will have to become her new captors, and force her to help us.
Either way, I'll reward the pair of you with another hilarious joke!
