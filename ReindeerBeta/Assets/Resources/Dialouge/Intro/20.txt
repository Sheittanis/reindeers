Oh dear I'm afraid the Elves have used some dark magic to force the wolves into helping them.
This magic has made the Wolves heads horribly disfigured. 
Specially their jaws.
These mutated monstrosities will hunt you down if you get too close.
Remember while you're killing them that they are being brain controlled so they really dont want to hurt you.
But at this point they look so horrible you're probably doing them a favor.
...
Anyway here's the joke.
<i>What do you call a lost wolf?</i>
