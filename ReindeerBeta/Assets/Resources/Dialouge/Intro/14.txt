It's really weird that you make me talk to you before doing any of these dangerous adventures.
I have better things to be doing you know.
Like making the final christmas presents that the Elves left before this little revolt.
But no I guess I'll have to keep accompanying you on these pointless outings.
Here's your joke I suppose.
