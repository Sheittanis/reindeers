<b>Splendid news!</b>
Another one of the sub-standard reindeer has been found useless to the elves.
The woodland critters have once again saved the day, unlike you, and tell me it's <color=green>Prancer</color>.
I'm sure she will join us out of the goodness of her own heart.
Why would an animal forced to carry a fat man around the planet each year without pay want to be released into the wild?
Plus, she'll want to be there for the hilarious joke.
<i>Why is <color=green>Prancer</color> always wet?</i>
