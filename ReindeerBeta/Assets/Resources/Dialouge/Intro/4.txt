<i>Bear</i> with me.
I have some news you might find <i>polar</i>ising.
I don't want you to <i>black</i> out on me when I tell you.
I'm not trying to <i>panda</i> to the elves, but this is quite a <i>spectacle</i>.
And, I know this wont get me any <i>brown</i>-y points, but you are a bit of a <i>sloth</i>.
What, you want me to just get on with it?
I'll have you know these are <i>koala</i>-ty puns, <i>sun</i>-ny jim!
But sure, I'll get on with it.
There be bears in these parts! So be careful.
Heres a hilarious joke to help you erase those bear puns from your memory.
<i>What did the polar bear eat after the elf fixed its teeth?</i>
