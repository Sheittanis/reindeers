Spectacular news!
There has been another reindeer sighting.
The woodland critters tell me the elves loved her too much to see her being hurt. It must be <color=fuchsia>Cupid</color>.
I'm sure you could imagine what it's like for someone to love you. Maybe.
Cupid is so lovely, I'm sure we wont have to use any physical force. As much as I'd love to.
There's nothing she loves more than a hilarious joke.
