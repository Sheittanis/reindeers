Phenomenal news!
A reindeer far superior to you has been spotted majesticly grazing up ahead.
"Absolutely awe inspiring" is what the woodland critters said.
It can only mean one thing.
<color=yellow>Blitzen</color>!
Let us pray that she is gracious enough to help us in our feable attempts to rescue Santa.
For we would not stand a chance in even an unfair fight against such a mighty being.
I hope that this hilarious joke is up to her standards.
