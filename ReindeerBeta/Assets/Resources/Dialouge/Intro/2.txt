Being the lovely, kind-natured, lady I am, I gave the elves the benefit of the doubt.
Maybe they just tied, gagged, and blindfolded Santa and the eight <b>actually popular</b> reindeer for the ultimate suprise party.
But it turns out that things have turned more sinister.
<i>More sinister?</i>
<i>Sinisterer???</i>
Anywho, the elves have laid down some spikes, so keep an eye out!
You will recognise them by how spikey they are.
The elves have also recruited some snowmen to lob their balls at you.
Just avoid them, snowmen are pretty harmless.
Besides we are surrounded by snow, they would just come back, and in greater numbers.
How about another hilarous joke to keep spirits up?
